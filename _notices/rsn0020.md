## Overview

We have recently become aware that `cuda-python` `11.7.1` has incorporated changes that makes it 
incompatible with current and legacy versions of RAPIDS when you try to install RAPIDS. You will 
need to pin `cuda-python' 11.7.1` in conda during installation, and potentially after.  An 
affected installation with the `11.7.1` issue results in this error being thrown:
```

```


## Status

Currently, we have these two resolution paths to offer:

	1. If you can upgrade, please upgrade your RAPIDS version to `v22.06.01` using our Release selector
	2. If you can NOT upgrade, for `v22.02`,  `v22.04`, and `v22.06`, is to pin `cuda-python` to `11.7.0` by using `cuda-python=11.7.0` when doing an install.  Example command: `conda install -c nvidia cuda-python=11.7.0`.  

Older versions of RAPIDS may also be affected and should attempt to upgrade or pin.

## Impact

This issue impacts users trying to install RAPIDS or install addtional libraries that may 
require an update to `cuda-python` and select `11.7.1`.
