## Overview

`CentOS8 images` will be deprecated in our upcoming release of `v22.04`
scheduled for April 2022. After the `v22.04` release, users should expect 
that support for `CentOS8 images` may be dropped at any point.

## Impact

Users should plan to move to `CentOS7 images` as soon as possible.  Further details will be shared in RSN notices as they become available.
