## Overview

`CUDA 10.1` & `10.2` will be deprecated in our upcoming release of `v0.19`
scheduled for April 2021. After `v0.19` support will be dropped entirely for
`CUDA 10.X`. More details will be released when they are available.

## Impact

Users should migrate to plan to move to `CUDA 11.0+` as soon as possible. More
versions of `CUDA 11.X` will be supported in upcoming releases with further
details shared in RSN notices as they become available.
