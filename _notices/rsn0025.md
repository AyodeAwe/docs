## Overview

With the deprecation of `Ubuntu 18.04` announced in [RSN 24](/notices/rsn0024), development
effort has been redirected to support `Unbuntu 22.04` in `v23.02` nightly releases.

## Status

Dropping support for Ubuntu 18.04 is an ongoing effort.

## Impact

Users should consider switching to any of the following supported operating systems for any `rapidsai/rapidsai` image:
  - Ubuntu 20.04
  - Ubuntu 22.04
  - CentOS 7
  - CentOS 8
