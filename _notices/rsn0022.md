## Overview

Python 3.9 will be deprecated in our upcoming release of v22.12 scheduled for December 2022. After the v22.12 release, users should expect that support for Python 3.9 may be dropped at any point.


## Impact

Users should plan to move to Python 3.10 as soon as possible. Future support of additional Python 3.11 version is being worked on for upcoming releases. Further details will be shared in RSN notices as they become available.
